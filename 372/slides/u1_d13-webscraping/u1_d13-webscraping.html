# Scraping the web

---

## Scraping the web: what? why?

- Increasing amount of data is available on the web
--

- These data are provided in an unstructured format: you can always copy&amp;paste, 
but it's time-consuming and prone to errors

--
- Web scraping is the process of extracting this information automatically and transform it into a structured dataset

--
- Two different scenarios:
    - Screen scraping: extract data from source code of website, with html 
    parser (easy) or regular expression matching (less easy).
    - Web APIs (application programming interface): website offers a set of 
    structured http requests that return JSON or XML files.

# Web Scraping with rvest

---

## Hypertext Markup Language

- Most of the data on the web is still largely available as HTML 
- It is structured (hierarchical / tree based), but it''s often not available in 
a form useful for analysis (flat / tidy).

```html
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p align="center"&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

---

## rvest

.pull-left[
- The **rvest** package makes basic processing and manipulation of HTML data straight forward
- It's designed to work with pipelines built with `%&gt;%`
]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/rvest.png" width="230" style="display: block; margin: auto 0 auto auto;" /&gt;
]

---

## Core rvest functions

- `read_html`   - Read HTML data from a url or character string
- `html_node `  - Select a specified node from HTML document
- `html_nodes`  - Select specified nodes from HTML document
- `html_table`  - Parse an HTML table into a data frame
- `html_text`   - Extract tag pairs' content
- `html_name`   - Extract tags' names
- `html_attrs`  - Extract all of each tag's attributes
- `html_attr`   - Extract tags' attribute value by name

---

## SelectorGadget

.pull-left[
- Open source tool that eases CSS selector generation and discovery
- Easiest to use with the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb) 
- Find out more on the [SelectorGadget vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/selectorgadget.html)
]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/selector-gadget.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---

## Using the SelectorGadget

.pull-left[
- Click on the app logo next to the search bar
- A box will open in the bottom right of the website
]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/selector-gadget.gif" width="100%" height="250" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

--

- Click on a page element (it will turn green), SelectorGadget will generate a 
minimal CSS selector for that element, and will highlight (yellow) everything 
that is matched by the selector

--
- Click on a highlighted element to remove it from the selector (red), or 
click on an unhighlighted element to add it to the selector

--
- Through this process of selection and rejection, SelectorGadget helps you come 
up with the appropriate CSS selector for your needs

# Top 250 movies on IMDB

---

## Top 250 movies on IMDB

Take a look at the source code, look for the tag `table` tag:
&lt;br&gt;
http://www.imdb.com/chart/top

![imdb_top](img/imdb_top_250.png)

---

## First check if you're allowed!


```r
library(robotstxt)
paths_allowed("http://www.imdb.com")
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

vs. e.g.


```r
paths_allowed("http://www.facebook.com")
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```


---

.your-turn[
- [RStudio Cloud](http://rstd.io/dsbox-cloud) &gt; `AE 08 - IMDB + Webscraping`.
- Open `01-imdb-250movies.R`.
- Follow along, and fill in the blanks as we go based on upcoming slides.

## Select and format pieces

.small[

```r
page &lt;- read_html("http://www.imdb.com/chart/top")

titles &lt;- page %&gt;%
  html_nodes(".titleColumn a") %&gt;%
  html_text()

years &lt;- page %&gt;%
  html_nodes(".secondaryInfo") %&gt;%
  html_text() %&gt;%
  str_replace("\\(", "") %&gt;% # remove (

  as.numeric()

scores &lt;- page %&gt;%
  html_nodes("#main strong") %&gt;%

## Clean up / enhance

May or may not be a lot of work depending on how messy the data are

- See if you like what you got:


```r
glimpse(imdb_top_250)
```

```
## Rows: 250
## Columns: 3
## $ title &lt;chr&gt; "The Shawshank Redemption", "The Godfather", "The Godfather: Part II", "The Dark Knâ€¦
## $ year  &lt;dbl&gt; 1994, 1972, 1974, 2008, 1957, 1993, 2003, 1994, 1966, 2001, 1999, 1994, 2010, 1980,â€¦
## $ score &lt;dbl&gt; 9.2, 9.1, 9.0, 9.0, 8.9, 8.9, 8.9, 8.8, 8.8, 8.8, 8.8, 8.8, 8.7, 8.7, 8.7, 8.6, 8.6â€¦
```

- Add a variable for rank

```r
imdb_top_250 &lt;- imdb_top_250 %&gt;%
  mutate(rank = 1:nrow(imdb_top_250))
```

## Potential challenges

- Unreliable formatting at the source
- Data broken into many pages
- ...

.question[
Compare the display of information at [gumtree.com/cars-vans-motorbikes/edinburgh](https://www.gumtree.com/cars-vans-motorbikes/edinburgh) to the list on the IMDB top 250 list. What challenges can you foresee in scraping a list of the available apartments?

.your-turn[
- [RStudio Cloud](http://rstd.io/dsbox-cloud) &gt; `AE 08 - IMDB + Webscraping`.
- Open `02-imdb-tvshows.R`.
- Scrape the names, scores, and years of most popular TV shows on IMDB:
[www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter](http://www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter).
- Create a data frame called `tvshows` with four variables: `rank`, `name`, `score`, `year`.
- Examine each of the **first three** TV shows to also obtain genre, runtime, how many episodes so far, first five plot keywords.
- Add this information to the `tvshows` data frame you created earlier.
