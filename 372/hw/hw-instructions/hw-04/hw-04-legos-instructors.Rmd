This week we'll do some data gymnastics to refresh and review what we learned over the past few weeks.

# Packages

In this assignment we will work with the `tidyverse` as usual ans the **dsbox** package for the data.

```{r load-package, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dsbox)
```

## Lego sales

We have (simulated) data from lego sales in 2018 for a sample of customers who bought legos in the US.  The dataset is called `lego_sales`. You can find descriptions of each of the variables in the help file for the dataset, which you can access by running `?lego_sales` in your Console.

Answer the following questions using pipelines. For each question, state your answer in a sentence, e.g. "The first three common names of purchasers are ...".

1. What are the three most common first names of purchasers?

2. What are the three most common themes of lego sets purchased?

3. Among the most common theme of lego sets purchased, what is the most common 
subtheme?

```{marginfigure}
*Hint:* Use the `case_when()` function.
```

4. Create a new variable called `age_group` and group the ages into the 
following categories: "18 and under", "19 - 25", "26 - 35", "36 - 50", "51 and over".

```{marginfigure}
*Hint:* You will need to consider quantity of purchases.
```

5. Which age group has purchased the highest number of lego sets. 

```{marginfigure}
*Hint:* You will need to consider quantity of purchases as well as price of 
lego sets.
```

6. Which age group has spent the most money on legos?

7. Come up with a question you want to answer using these data, and write it down. 
Then, create a data visualization that answers the question, and explain how 
your visualization answers the question.

## Instructional staff employment trends

The next dataset is about instructional staff employee hiring trends between 1975 and 2011. 
The dataset is called `instructors`. You can find descriptions of each of the variables in the help file for the dataset, which you can access by running `?instructors` in your Console.

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is a nonprofit membership association of faculty and other academic professionals. [This report](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUP_Report_InstrStaff-75-11_apr2013.pdf) compiled by the AAUP shows trends in instructional staff employees between 1975 and 2011, and contains an image very similar to the one given below.

```{r instructors, echo = FALSE, fig.width=7}
knitr::include_graphics("img/instructors.png")
```

During the lab you had a chance to discuss with your teammates how you 
would improve upon this visualization if the main objective was to communicate 
that the proportion of part-time faculty have gone up over time compared to 
other instructional staff types.

8. Implement the improvements and provide your improved visualization as part 
of your answer. Also write a few sentences about why you chose to make these 
improvements and how they address the main goal stated above. Feel free to reuse 
any code from the lab.
