GDH provides ice cream for its wonderful customers. I LOVE GDH.  Do you love it as much as me (let's discuss)?  


In the last three years GDH used ice cream, in pounds, by month, as shown in the attached file.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
Month.Name <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
year1 <- c(60, 68, 83, 102, 95, 57, 61, 109, 56, 53, 74, 73)
year2 <- c(67, 67, 62, 95, 105, 89, 57, 109, 86, 53, 72, 64)
year3 <- c(64, 72, 61, 107, 101, 75, 81, 104, 88, 65, 72, 65)
ice.cream <- data.frame(Month.Name,year1, year2, year3)
print(ice.cream, row.names = FALSE)
```
